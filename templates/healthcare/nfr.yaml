      ## NFR: HIPAA Technical Requirements

      ### Data Protection
      - PHI (Protected Health Information) encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
      - PHI access requires authentication + authorization + audit log entry.
      - Database columns containing PHI tagged and documented in data dictionary.
      - PHI never appears in logs, error messages, URLs, or analytics events.

      ### Access Control
      - Role-based access: minimum necessary access for each role.
      - Break-glass emergency access with mandatory post-access review.
      - Session timeout: {{session_timeout | default: 15 minutes}} of inactivity for PHI-accessible sessions.
      - Access audit reviewed {{access_review_frequency | default: monthly}}.

      ### Audit
      - All PHI access logged: WHO accessed WHAT data, WHEN, from WHERE, for what PURPOSE.
      - Audit logs immutable, retained for minimum {{hipaa_audit_retention | default: 6 years}}.
      - Audit log integrity verified (checksums, append-only storage).
      - Anomaly detection on access patterns (unusual hours, volume, or scope).

      ## NFR: HIPAA Operational

      ### Business Associate Agreements
      - BAA in place with every vendor that touches PHI (cloud provider, analytics, logging).
      - Vendor compliance status tracked and reviewed annually.

      ### Incident Response
      - Breach notification process documented. HIPAA requires notification within 60 days.
      - Incident response team identified. Contact list current.
      - Breach detection mechanisms: anomalous access patterns, data exfiltration monitoring.

      ### Backup & Recovery
      - PHI backups encrypted, stored in HIPAA-compliant storage.
      - RPO: < {{healthcare_rpo | default: 1 hour}}. RTO: < {{healthcare_rto | default: 4 hours}}.
      - Backup restoration tested quarterly. Results documented.
      - Data retention and destruction policies per HIPAA requirements.
