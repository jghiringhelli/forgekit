      ## Transaction Integrity & Financial Data Precision

      - Never use floating-point types for monetary values. Use fixed-precision decimal types (e.g., `Decimal`, `BigDecimal`, `NUMERIC(19,4)`) or integer minor units (cents/pips) throughout the entire stack.
      - Ensure all financial operations are ACID-compliant. Use database transactions with appropriate isolation levels (at minimum READ COMMITTED; use SERIALIZABLE for balance mutations).
      - Implement double-entry bookkeeping: every transaction creates at least two ledger entries (debit and credit) that sum to zero. Validate this invariant on every write.
      - Make all transaction processing idempotent using client-supplied idempotency keys. Retry-safe APIs prevent duplicate charges or transfers.
      - Record immutable transaction history. Financial records are append-only; corrections are modeled as reversing entries, never as in-place updates or deletes.
      - Perform end-of-day reconciliation between internal ledgers and external payment processor/bank records. Alert immediately on any discrepancy.
      - Store and display all monetary amounts with their ISO 4217 currency code. Never assume a default currency.

      ## Audit Trails & Regulatory Compliance

      - Maintain a tamper-evident, append-only audit log for every state change to accounts, transactions, and user permissions. Include actor, timestamp, old value, new value, and IP address.
      - Implement PCI-DSS controls if handling cardholder data: network segmentation, encryption, access logging, vulnerability scanning, and annual compliance assessments.
      - Mask or tokenize sensitive financial identifiers (account numbers, SSNs, card PANs) in logs, error messages, and non-production environments.
      - Enforce KYC/AML checks at onboarding and on an ongoing basis. Integrate with identity verification and sanctions screening providers via well-defined service boundaries.
      - Retain financial records and audit logs for the period required by applicable regulations (typically 5-7 years). Automate archival and ensure archived data remains queryable for audits.
      - Design for regulatory reporting: build data models and pipelines that can produce required reports (SAR, CTR, regulatory filings) with minimal manual intervention.

      ## Security & Operational Resilience

      - Implement multi-factor authentication for all user-facing financial operations above a configurable threshold (e.g., transfers > $500).
      - Apply velocity checks and fraud detection rules: flag unusual transaction volumes, amounts, geographies, or timing patterns for review before processing.
      - Use cryptographic signing (HMAC or asymmetric signatures) for all webhook payloads, inter-service financial messages, and API requests to prevent tampering.
      - Design for graceful degradation: if an external payment provider is unavailable, queue transactions for retry rather than failing the user experience entirely.
      - Maintain a disaster recovery plan with RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 4 hours for critical financial services. Test failover procedures quarterly.
      - Separate read and write paths for high-throughput systems. Use CQRS to ensure reporting queries never contend with transaction processing.
