      ## CLI Standards

      ### User Experience
      - Clear, concise help text for every command and option.
      - Consistent flag naming: --verbose, --output, --format across all commands.
      - Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for general error, 2 for usage error.
      - Colored output for terminals that support it, plain text fallback.
      - Progress indicators for long-running operations.

      ### Input/Output
      - Accept input from stdin, arguments, and config files.
      - Support --json flag for machine-readable output.
      - Support --quiet flag to suppress non-essential output.
      - Never prompt for input in non-interactive mode (CI/CD).

      ### Distribution
      - Single binary or npx-invocable package.
      - Minimal dependencies — fast install.
      - Version command: --version prints version and exits.

      ### Error Messages

      - Suggest the correct command when user mistypes.
      - Link to documentation for complex errors.
