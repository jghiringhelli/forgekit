      ### SLAs
      - Data freshness SLA: {{freshness_sla | default: 1 hour}} from source to destination.
      - Pipeline success rate: ≥ {{pipeline_success_rate | default: 99%}} per day.
      - Alert on SLA breach within 15 minutes.

      ### Idempotency
      - Every pipeline step is idempotent — safe to rerun without duplicating data.
      - Backfill supported: reprocess historical date ranges without manual intervention.
      - Partial failures resume from last checkpoint, not from scratch.

      ### Data Quality
      - Schema validation at ingestion. Reject or quarantine malformed records.
      - Row count, null rate, uniqueness, and distribution checks after each stage.
      - Data quality metrics tracked over time. Alert on anomalies.

      ## NFR: Pipeline Performance

      ### Throughput
      - Target throughput: {{pipeline_throughput | default: 100K records/minute}}.
      - Batch vs. streaming decision documented with rationale.
      - Partitioning strategy aligned with query patterns.

      ### Resource Management
      - Compute resources auto-scale with data volume. No over-provisioning for peak.
      - Cost per GB processed tracked. Budget alerts at 80% threshold.
      - Temporary/staging data cleaned up automatically after pipeline completion.
