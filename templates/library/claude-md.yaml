      ## Library / Package Standards

      ### Public API
      - Clear, minimal public API surface. Export only what consumers need.
      - Barrel file (index.ts / __init__.py) defines the public API explicitly.
      - Internal modules prefixed with underscore or in internal/ directory.
      - Every public API has JSDoc/docstring with examples.

      ### Versioning & Compatibility
      - Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
      - MAJOR: breaking API changes. MINOR: new features, backward compatible. PATCH: bug fixes.
      - CHANGELOG.md maintained with every release.
      - Deprecation warnings before removal (minimum 1 minor version).

      ### Distribution
      - Package includes only dist/ and necessary runtime files.
      - Types included (declaration files for TypeScript).
      - Peer dependencies used for framework integrations.
      - Minimize runtime dependencies — every dep is a risk.

      ### Testing
      - Test against the public API, not internals.
      - Test with multiple versions of peer dependencies.
      - Integration tests simulate real consumer usage patterns.

      ### Documentation
      - README with: install, quick start, API reference, examples.
      - Usage examples for every major feature.
      - Migration guide for every major version bump.
